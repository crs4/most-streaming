====================================
Welcome to MOST's Streaming Module documentation!
====================================

The MOST project aims to achieve an open, modular and scalable solution for the creation, execution and management of remote clinical consultations with direct interaction between specialists.

The project consists of a set of frameworks that deal with different aspects and technologies useful for the creation of telemedicine applications.

Streaming Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Streaming Framework allows you to create desktop and mobile application capable of retrieve, decode and display AV stream transmitted by medical device and network cameras.

The framework is based on opensource library `GStreamer <http://gstreamer.com>`_. GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.

Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface.
